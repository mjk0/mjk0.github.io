            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Jigsaw Puzzles lets you turn any image into a jigsaw puzzle.
                Try the samples images, or select your own.  Set the difficulty by
                increasing the number of pieces.
            </p>
            <p>As you work on a puzzle, your progress is saved automatically.
                If needed, you can resume your most recent in-progress puzzle.
            </p>
            <h2>Selecting an image</h2>
            <h3>Sample Images
                <img class="right" src="media/h-browse-480px.jpg" width="480" height="222"/>
            </h3>
            <p>To browse sample images, click the
                <span class="b-img-span">Browse Samples</span> button.
                The image selection dialog will appear.  Click on any of the thumbnail images
                to select it and show a larger version in the preview side.  When you are
                happy with your image selection, click <span class="bspan">Select</span>
                to finalize your selection.
            </p>
            <h3>Resuming a puzzle where you left off</h3>
            <p>If you didn't complete your last puzzle, Jigsaw Puzzles will initially show
                the last puzzle image, and also show a
                <span class="bspan"><i class="material-icons">send</i> Resume Last</span> button.
                <img class="right" src="media/h-resume-240px.jpg" width="240" height="161"/>
                You can resume from the automatically saved
                state as long as you don't <span class="gspan">Scramble</span> a new image.
            </p>
            <p>If you don't want to resume, click on one of the image source selection buttons:
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li><div class="b-img-div">Browse Samples</div></li>
                    <li><div class="b-img-div"><i
                    class="material-icons">insert_link</i> From URL</div></li>
                    <li><div class="b-img-div"><i
                    class="material-icons">computer</i> From Computer</div></li>
                    <li><div class="b-img-div"><i
                        class="material-icons">cloud_download</i> From Other Players</div></li>
                </ul>
                to select your next jigsaw puzzle image.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Images - <i class="material-icons">insert_link</i> From URL</h3>
            <p>
                You can use any web-based image as your jigsaw puzzle image.
                As long as you can form a valid URL for the image, you can use it.
            </p>
            <h4><img class="left mw25" src="media/h-custom-copy-address-240px.jpg" width="240" height="266"/>
                Here are typical steps to selecting a custom puzzle image,
                using the Chrome browser:
            </h4>
            <ul class="ul-indent"><li>
                    Find an image you like, preferably in another browser tab
                    <ul><li><a href="https://images.google.com">Google Image Search</a>
                        is a good starting point</li>
                        <li>Use a search word such as "art" to find art images.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the image is large or medium for good detail</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Right-click on the image, and select "Copy image address"</li>
                <li>In the Jigsaw Puzzles window, select the
                    <span class="b-img-span"><i
                        class="material-icons">insert_link</i> From URL</span> button,
                    then paste the image URL using Ctrl-V on desktop/laptop,
                    or long-press on tablets.  Hit Enter or click on
                    <span class="bspan">Select</span> to close the dialog.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="clear-left"><br>Custom Images - <i class="material-icons">computer</i> From Computer</h3>
            <p>
                You can use any image on your computer as your jigsaw puzzle image.
                Click on the <span class="b-img-span"><i
                    class="material-icons">computer</i> From Computer</span> button
                to open the file selection dialog.
            </p>
            <h3 class="clear-left"><br>Custom Images - <i
                class="material-icons">cloud_download</i> From Other Players</h3>
            <p>
                You can browse the images of puzzles that have been recently completed
                by others Jigsaw Puzzles players.  Only public images, found using the
                <span class="b-img-span"><i
                    class="material-icons">insert_link</i> From URL</span> button,
                are added to the shared list.  Images from websites that require authentication,
                such as personal photo albums on Google Photos, will not be shared with others.
            </p><p>
                Click on the <span class="b-img-span"><i
                    class="material-icons">cloud_download</i> From Other Players</span> button
                to open the Recent Completions dialog.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Images - Advanced</h3>
            <p>Advanced users have the option of embedding a custom image URL directly
                into the link that launches the Jigsaw Puzzles landing page.
                Append "?url=", followed by an image URL.  Clicking on such a link
                will pre-select the given custom image URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can test that the custom image URL is valid by clicking on the
                <span class="bspan">Test</span> button
            </p>
            <h2>Play Options</h2>
            <h3>Number of pieces</h3>
            <p>The number of pieces selection sets the difficulty level.
                50 pieces is the easiest.  100 or 200 are moderately difficult,
                while 400 pieces provides a more time-consuming challenge.
                The higher selections for the number of pieces should only be
                attempted on large screens.
            </p>
            <p>On desktops and laptops, you may be able to toggle full-screen mode with F11</p>
            <h3>Zoom level</h3>
            <p>A zoom level of 50% means that the completed puzzle will occupy 50%
                of the browser window area.  A smaller zoom level will provide more
                working space after scrambling the puzzle.  The default zoom level of 33%
                should provide ample working area for puzzle pieces.
            </p>
            <h2>Working on the puzzle</h2>
            <p>Press the <span class="bspan"><i class="material-icons">send</i> Start</span>
                button to begin working on the puzzle.                
            </p>
            <p>The puzzle play starts by showing the completed puzzle.  If you are happy
                with the puzzle image and settings, click
                <span class="gspan">Scramble</span> to randomize the pieces.
                The position and movement of all pieces will now be saved automatically
                as you play.
            </p>
            <p>To move puzzle pieces, press and drag the piece to a new location.
                When you move matching pieces next to each other, they will snap
                together.  You can then drag the group as one piece.
