            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Jigsaw Puzzles lets you turn any image into a jigsaw puzzle.
                Try the samples images, or select your own.  Set the difficulty by
                increasing the number of pieces.
            </p>
            <p>As you work on a puzzle, your progress is saved automatically.
                If needed, you can resume your most recent in-progress puzzle.
            </p>
            <h2>Selecting an image</h2>
            <h3>Sample Images
                <img class="right" src="media/h-sample-images-240px.jpg" width="240" height="126"/>
            </h3>
            <p>To browse sample images, make sure the
                <span class="gspan">Sample Images</span> tab is selected.
                Center your selection in the image carousel, then proceed to the
                next step.
            </p>
            <h3>Resuming a puzzle where you left off
                <img class="right" src="media/h-resume-240px.jpg" width="240" height="108"/>
            </h3>
            <p>If you didn't complete your last puzzle, Jigsaw Puzzles will initially show
                the <span>Resume</span> tab.  You can resume from the automatically saved
                state as long as you don't <span class="gspan">Scramble</span> a new image.
            </p>
            <p>If you don't want to resume, select either the
                <span class="gspan">Sample Images</span> tab, or the
                <span class="gspan">Custom Image</span> tab to select
                your next jigsaw puzzle image.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Images
                <img class="right" src="media/h-custom-image-240px.jpg" width="240" height="107"/>
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can use any web-based image as your jigsaw puzzle image.
                As long as you can form a valid URL for the image, you can use it.
            </p>
            <h4><img class="left" src="media/h-custom-copy-address-240px.jpg" width="240" height="266"/>
                Here are typical steps to selecting a custom puzzle image,
                using the Chrome browser:
            </h4>
            <ul class="ul-indent"><li>
                    <img class="right" src="media/h-custom-paste-240px.png" width="240" height="112"/>
                    Find an image you like, preferably in another browser tab
                    <ul><li><a href="https://images.google.com">Google Image Search</a>
                        is a good starting point</li>
                        <li>Use a search word such as "art" to find art images.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the image is large or medium for good detail</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Right-click on the image, and select "Copy image address"</li>
                <li>In the Jigsaw Puzzles window, select the
                    <span class="gspan">Custom Image</span> tab,
                    then paste the image URL:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click on the <span class="bspan">Clear & Paste (Control-V)</span> button</li>
                        <li>Paste using Control-V on desktop/laptop, or long-press on tablets</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="clear-left"><br/>Custom Images - Advanced</h3>
            <p>Advanced users have the option of embedding a custom image URL directly
                into the link that launches the Jigsaw Puzzles landing page.
                Append "?url=", followed by an image URL.  Clicking on such a link
                will pre-select the given custom image URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can test that the custom image URL is valid by clicking on the
                <span class="bspan">Test</span> button
            </p>
            <h2>Play Options</h2>
            <h3>Number of pieces</h3>
            <p>The number of pieces selection sets the difficulty level.
                50 pieces is the easiest.  100 or 200 are moderately difficult,
                while 400 pieces provides a more time-consuming challenge.
                The higher selections for the number of pieces should only be
                attempted on large screens.
            </p>
            <p>On desktps and laptops, you may be able to toggle full-screen mode with F11</p>
            <h3>Zoom level</h3>
            <p>A zoom level of 50% means that the completed puzzle will occupy 50%
                of the browser window area.  A smaller zoom level will provide more
                working space after scrambling the puzzle.  The default zoom level of 33%
                should provide ample working area for puzzle pieces.
            </p>
            <h2>Working on the puzzle</h2>
            <p>Press the <span class="bspan">Start</span> button to begin working on
                the puzzle.                
            </p>
            <p>The puzzle play starts by showing the completed puzzle.  If you are happy
                with the puzzle image and settings, click
                <span class="gspan">Scramble</span> to randomize the pieces.
                The position and movement of all pieces will now be saved automatically
                as you play.
            </p>
            <p>To move puzzle pieces, press and drag the piece to a new location.
                When you move matching pieces next to each other, they will snap
                together.  You can then drag the group as one piece.
            </p>
