<h3>Auction 45s Card Game Rules</h3>
<p>

Players
</p><p>

The game is played with 4 players, in teams of two (those sitting opposite each other are on a team). 
</p><p>

Game Play
</p><p>

Dealing
</p><p>

Each player receives 5 cards, dealt in a group of 3, followed by a group of two.
There is also a "kitty" of four cards from which the winning bidder can draw.
The dealer deals 3 cards to the person to his left and to each subsequent player
(including himself), then 2 to the kitty and 2 more to each player as well as
two more to the kitty.
</p><p>

Variants:
</p><p>

the kitty is dealt three cards following the first round and gets no subsequent
cards (3 total)
the last card dealt to the kitty is turned face up to give players a "taste" of
what is inside
there is no kitty
The Auction (bidding)
</p><p>

Each "trick" is worth 5 points, except the trick involving the best card in play
which is worth 10 points. Thus, with 5 cards each, the total points for each
hand is 30. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player bids
(or passes) in multiples of 5 starting at a minimum of 15. A player bids the
number of points they assume they (and their partner) can win in the hand. A
player may pass or bid higher than the bid currently on the table.
</p><p>

When the bid reaches the dealer, he may choose to "hold" it. If the bid stands
at 20, and the deal holds it, he is exercising his privilege of bidding 20 as
well. The high bidder and the dealer may then auction up until one gives up.
</p><p>

example: Player 1 bids 15. Player 2 passes. Player 3 bids 20. The dealer holds
the bid. Player 3 bids 25. The dealer, not wanting to bid 25, allows Player 3 to
take the bid at 25.
</p><p>

The high bidder must now call which suit will be "trump" and then gets to pick
through the kitty for any better cards that may be within in.
</p><p>

If someone bids 30, which means they must take all of the tricks, this is called
a 30 for 60 bid. This means that if they manage to take all of the tricks, they
add 60 points to their score as opposed to 30. If they loose their bid they
still only loose 30.
</p><p>

If a player/team is "in the hole" (has less then 0 points), then they may bid up
past a 30 bid to a "60 for 120 bid".
</p><p>

Additionally, if a bidder has a poor hand but has won the bid, he may choose to
discard his entire hand and then take the kitty before declaring trump.
</p><p>

Variants:
</p><p>

there is no 60 for 120 bid
there is no 30 for 60 bid
the winning bidder may see the kitty before calling a suit
the dealer cannot hold but bids just as a normal player
the winning bidder may look at the kitty before declaring the trump
</p><p>

Discarding
</p><p>

After the winner of the bid calls the suit, players may discard. A player may
discard any, all or none of his cards. Normally a player discards all of their
non-trump, but this can vary depending on individual strategy.
</p><p>

Once players have discarded, the dealer fills each hand back up to 5, dealing no
more than 3 cards at a time, as above.

<p>

    Playing a hand
</p><p>

    The person to the left of the winning bidder plays the first card and then
the person to his left plays until it reaches the winning bidder. The best card
laid takes the trick.
</p><p>
   
    NOTE:
</p><p>
        - trump beats any other card regardless of value.
    -if no trump is played, then the suit of the first card laid is considered
trump for determining the winner of that round
</p><p>
   
    The winner of each round leads, then each player lays a card in turn, going
clockwise (to the left).
</p><p>
   
    If the player/team who took the bid doesn't get points equal or great to
their bid then they are "set". This means that, regardless of the points earned
in the hand, the bidding player/team has the value of their bid deducted from
their score.
</p><p>
   
    The non bidding player/team gains any points from the tricks they manage in
the hand. This is unless they are past 100 points, at which time you have to
"take the bid to count", that is to say once you pass 100, you must be the
winning bidder in order to increase your score.
</p><p>
   
    Variants:
</p><p>
   
    the person who wins the bid leads, not the person to his left
    you only need to make a bid in order to count after 100
    you only must bid 20 (and not necessarily take the bid) to count after 100
    all above rules for reaching 100 points take effect at 90
</p><p>

    Following Suit
</p><p>
   
    If trump is the first card laid, all other players must also play trump if
they have any trump in their hand. The exception to this is the 5 of trump which
can be "reneged" against all other trump cards and the Jack of trump which can
be reneged against all other trump except for the 5.
</p><p>
   
    If trump isn't lead, then the suit does not have to be followed. Any player
can play the card of their choice. A common strategy is for the person leading
in the first hand to play a low value non-trump card but for another player to
play trump before the person who has taken the bid in order to force him or her
to play trump to take the trick.
</p><p>
   
    Variants:
</p><p>
   
    there is no reneging
    only the 5 can be reneged
    the 5 and Jack of trump, and the Ace of hearts can be reneged
    Winning or Losing
</p><p>
   
    The first player/team to 125 wins the game.
