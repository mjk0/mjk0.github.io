<h4>Players</h4>

<p>
The game is played with 4 players, in teams of two (those sitting opposite each other are on a team). 
</p>
<h2>Game Play</h2>
<h3>
Dealing
</h3><p>

Each player receives 5 cards, dealt in a group of 3, followed by a group of two.
There is also a "kitty" of four cards from which the winning bidder can draw.
The dealer deals 3 cards to the person to his left and to each subsequent player
(including himself), then 2 to the kitty and 2 more to each player as well as
two more to the kitty.
</p>
<h3>The Auction (bidding)</h3>
<p>
Each "trick" is worth 5 points, except the trick involving the best card in play
which is worth 10 points. Thus, with 5 cards each, the total points for each
hand is 30. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player bids
(or passes) in multiples of 5 starting at a minimum of 15. A player bids the
number of points they assume they (and their partner) can win in the hand. A
player may pass or bid higher than the bid currently on the table.
A player that has passed once may not bid again in the current hand.
</p><p>

When the bid reaches the dealer, he may choose to "hold" it. If the bid stands
at 20, and the deal holds it, he is exercising his privilege of bidding 20 as
well. The high bidder and the dealer may then auction up until one gives up.
</p><p><i>

example: Player 1 bids 15. Player 2 passes. Player 3 bids 20. The dealer holds
the bid. Player 3 bids 25. The dealer, not wanting to bid 25, allows Player 3 to
take the bid at 25.
</i></p><p>

The high bidder gets to pick
through the kitty for any better cards that may be within in,
then declares the trump suit to complete the contract.
</p><p>

If someone bids 30, which means they must take all of the tricks, this is called
a 30 for 60 bid. This means that if they manage to take all of the tricks, they
add 60 points to their score as opposed to 30. If they loose their bid they
still only loose 30.
</p><p>

If a player/team is "in the hole" (has less then 0 points), then they may bid up
past a 30 bid to a "60 for 120 bid".
</p>

<h3>Discarding</h3>
<p>
After the winner of the bid calls the suit, players may discard. A player may
discard any, all or none of his cards. Normally a player discards all of their
non-trump, but this can vary depending on individual strategy.
</p><p>

Once players have discarded, the dealer fills each hand back up to 5, dealing no
more than 3 cards at a time, as above.

</p>

<p>
The rank of cards within a suit can change based on whether the suit is trump or not trump. 
The lower valued cards are worth the same in the hierarchy whether they are trump or non-trump,
though their value varies based on their colour. The "rule of thumb" is
"highest in red, lowest in black," that is to say that the 2 of clubs is
the second-best non-face club, and the 10 of diamonds is the best non-face diamond.
</p>

<h3>
    Playing a hand
</h3>
<p>

The person to the left of the winning bidder plays the first card.
Play then proceeds in clockwise order until it reaches the winning bidder. The best card
laid takes the trick.
</p><p>
   
<i>NOTE:</i>
</p><ul>
<li>trump beats any other card regardless of value.</li>
<li>if no trump is played, then the suit of the first card laid is considered
trump for determining the winner of that round</li>
</ul><p>
   
    The winner of each round leads, then each player lays a card in turn, going
clockwise (to the left).
</p><p>
   
    If the player/team who took the bid doesn't get points equal to or great than
their bid, then they are "set". This means that, regardless of the points earned
in the hand, the bidding player/team has the value of their bid deducted from
their score.
</p><p>
   
    The non-bidding player/team gains any points from the tricks they manage in
the hand. An exception is if they are past 100 points, in which case they have to
have placed a bid in order to increase their score.
</p>
<h3>
    Following Suit
</h3>
<p>
   
    If trump is the first card laid, all other players must also play trump if
they have any trump in their hand. The exception to this is the 5 of trump which
can be "reneged" against all other trump cards.
</p><p>
   
    If trump isn't lead, then the suit does not have to be followed. Any player
can play the card of their choice. A common strategy is for the person leading
in the first hand to play a low value non-trump card but for another player to
play trump before the person who has taken the bid in order to force him or her
to play trump to take the trick.
</p>
<h3>
    Winning or Losing
</h3>
<p>
    The first player/team to 125 wins the game.
