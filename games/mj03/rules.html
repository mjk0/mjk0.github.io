<h3>Ma-Jong Rules</h3>
<p>These are the Ma-Jong rules played by at least one family in Shanghai.&nbsp; 
Add up the points for each matching rule to get your point score.&nbsp; Rules 
that cause score doubling are listed below the various point rules.</p>
<h4>Definitions:</h4>
<p><b>'po / 碰牌'</b> means that
you claim a piece as it is being discarded to make a 
set of 3 identical pieces.&nbsp; You can 'po' from any player, even if it would 
not normally have been your turn to play next. The first two pieces of the set 
of 3 must come from the player's hand.</p>
<p><b>'cha / 吃'</b> means that you claim a piece as it is being discarded to make a 
straight of 3.&nbsp; You can only 'cha' from the player to your right since you 
must follow the normal order of each player's turn.&nbsp; This assumes that 
players take turns in a clockwise order.&nbsp; Two pieces of the straight of 3 
must come from the player's hand.</p>
<p><b>'gahng / 扛'</b> means that you are making a set of 4 identical pieces.&nbsp; 
This can be done by claiming a piece as it is being discarded by any player, 
just as with a 'po', and all 'po' rules apply will also apply.&nbsp; It can also 
be done by drawing a piece from the deck as would normally be done at the start 
of each player's turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first three pieces of the set of 4 must 
come from the player's hand.&nbsp; To compensate for the 4<sup>th</sup> piece in the set, 
the player draws an extra piece from the flower-end of the deck.&nbsp; If the 
4<sup>th</sup> piece was drawn normally, and not from another player's discarded piece 
('po'), then the set of 4 must be played face-down so that others cannot see 
which set of 4 has been played from the player's hand.&nbsp; For scoring 
purposes, a set of 4 can always count as a set of 3.</p>
<p><b>'zzzmo / 自摸'</b> means that you got the winning piece by drawing it yourself, 
not by claiming a piece as it was being discarded by another player.</p>
<p><b>'ztail / 槓上開花'</b> is the same as zzzmo, except that the
winning tile was drawn from the flower pile, which would happen when
drawing a replacement tile after playing a flower or creating a gahng.</p>
<p><b>'words'</b> are the pieces that don't have a number associated with them.&nbsp; 
These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the 4 winds (east, south, west, north), and</li>
	<li>the 3 non-wind words: fa (prosperity), middle, and babei (nothing)</li>
</ul>
