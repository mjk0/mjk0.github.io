    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>This is a 4-player Mahjong game.
        After selecting your username, you will be able to join any open game,
        or create a private invitational game.
        During gameplay, unfilled seats will be filled by robot players.
    </p>
    <h4>Sign-In</h4>

            <img class="h-signin" src="media/h/h-SignIn.jpg">
            <figcaption><i>Fig. 1: Sign-in screen</i></figcaption>
        </figure>

            <img class="h-lobby" src="media/h/h-Lobby.jpg">
            <figcaption><i>Fig. 2: Lobby view of players,
                games & past series</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>Begin by typing a username in (A).
        You may select any username that is not already reserved.
        Your username will identify you in the lobby, and in games
        once play starts.
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to reserve your username so that no one else can use it,
        add your email address in field (B).  Your email address acts as
        your password.
    </p>
    <p>After signing in, if you would like to sign in with a different username,
        click on <i>Sign out</i>, as shown in Fig 2-F.
    </p>
    <h4>Lobby Game Choices</h4>
    <p>Each Mahjong game seats up to 4 players.
        Games can be either <i>Public</i>, or <i>Invitational</i>.
        The difference is that invitational games are private, and only
        players who are invited may join, whereas public games are
        open to anyone to join.
    </p>
    <p>All players who are currently connected to the server are shown
        in the player panel (Fig 2-E).
    </p>
    <h5>Joining A Public Game</h5>
    <p>The game server will ensure that there are always empty games available.
        In the <i>Public Games</i> section (Fig 2-C), wherever you
        see a button labelled as <b>SIT</b>,
        <img class="iem" src="media/h/h-SIT.png" style="width: 1.9em;">,
        that means that the seat is open, and you may sit there by clicking
        the button.
    </p>
    <p>As soon as one player is seated, a
        <img class="iem" src="media/h/h-Start.png" style="width: 1.3em;">
        start button will appear
        in the <i>Status</i> column.  If you are not waiting for others
        to join, you can click the start button at any time.  Empty seats
        will be automatically filled by robot players.
    </p>
    <p>If you see a game with <b>JOIN</b> buttons,
        <img class="iem" src="media/h/h-JOIN.png" style="width: 2.43em;">,
        this means the game has already started, but still has open seats.
        Clicking on any of the join buttons will immediately take you
        into that game, where you will replace a robot player.
    </p>
    <h5>Creating Your Own Invitational Game</h5>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-invite" src="media/h/h-Invite.png">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 3: Invitational: New Game</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        You can create an invitational game by clicking the <b>NEW GAME</b>
        button (Fig 2-D).  You will be listed as the owner of
        a new game with 4 open seats as shown in (Fig 3-D2),
        and you will have the option of inviting other players to your game.
        Only the owner and invited players can see the invitational game.
    </p>
    <h5>Resuming A Game Series</h5>
    <p>
        A game series means that the selection of dealer, wind,
        and scoring will run continuously through multiple games.
        When an in-progress game ends in a win (Woo) or a stalemate
        (because the deck runs out), the players may continue to the next
        game, with dealer and wind advancing according to the game rules.
    </p>
    <p>When game-play has completed, and all players have left the game,
        the server will save a record of the game series, so that the
        players can continue the game at a later date.  The saved game
        series will appear in the lower part of the <i>Invitational Games</i>
        section, and be visible only to players who participated in the
        game.
    </p>
    <p>Game series controls are shown in Fig 3:-D3-D4-D5.  In this example,
        there are two saved game series: one that was last played
        on 2021-09-12 (year-month-date), and another that was last played
        on 2021-09-18.  Clicking on the date buttons in Fig 3-D4 will
        show a summary of the running game scores.
    </p>
    <p>You can resume a past game series by clicking the resume icon, 
        <img class="iem" src="media/h/h-resume.png" style="width: 1.786em;">,
        found to the left of Fig 3-D3.
        This creates an invitational game with all past participants
        invited and listed as owners.  Below each <b>SIT</b> button, the name
        of the most recent occupant of that seat will be shown.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, if you are not interested in resuming a series, you can delete it from
        the server by clicking the trash icon in Fig 3-D5.
    </p>
    <h5>Other Lobby Game Controls</h5>
    <p>Fig 3-D6 shows additional controls for game owners.
        The chart icon, <i class="material-icons iem teal-text">timeline</i>,
        will show a summary of the scores of an in-progress
        game series, but only once the first game has completed.
        The orange stop icon,
        <i class="material-icons iem orangered-text">cancel</i>,
        will terminate a game, ejecting
        any seated players.
    </p>
    <h4>Game Play</h4>
    <p>After joining a game or starting a game in the lobby, your view switches to
    the game table.  The game server will have already dealt needed tiles to
    each player, such that the
    dealer has 14 tiles, and each other player has 13 tiles.  In addition, since
    flower tiles must always be played immediately, the game server will have
    already played all flower tiles, and dealt replacements.</p>
    <p>Game plays starts with the dealer.  When it is your turn,
        you can make optional plays if you have any available.
        Your turn ends when you discard a tile, or declare a win (Woo).
    </p>
    <h5>The Game Window</h5>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-gwindow" src="media/h/h-gwindow.jpg">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 4: The Game Window</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The game window includes play areas to display tiles for each of the
        4 players (Fig 4: P1-P4).  Your play area is at the bottom of
        the window, and includes your flowers & sets (Fig 4-F) and
        your unplayed tiles (Fig 4-P1).  For the 3 other players, only
        flowers and sets are visible, with unplayed tiles remaining hidden.
    </p>
    <h6>Wind, Score History, and Discards</h6>
    <p>The area in the upper left corner of the game window, shown
        in Fig 4-W, displays the current wind and the 4 most recently
        discarded tiles.  The discarded tiles are also a button. Clicking on
        them will display a full history of discarded tiles for the
        current game.
    </p>
    <p>Similarly, clicking on the SCORE HISTORY button displays a scoring
        summary since the beginning of the current game series.
    </p>
    <h5>Your Hand</h5>
    <p>Your unplayed tiles (Fig 4-P1) are initially sorted, with gaps between
        suit groupings.  If you don't rearrange your tiles, the game will
        keep the tiles sorted by inserting newly drawn tiles in the appropriate
        sorted position.
    </p>
    <p>You can also choose to rearrange your tiles as you wish.  Moving
        any tile from its sorted position will disable the
        <i>auto-sort tiles</i> option shown in Fig 4-A1.  If you prefer
        have the tiles sorted for you, you can re-enable this option.
        The gear icon,
        <i class="material-icons iem seagreen-text">settings</i>,
        in Fig 4-A2 displays the tile auto-sort settings.
    </p>
    <p>If you rearrange your tiles, newly drawn tiles will appear at the
        end of the existing tiles.  When you move a tile to a spot that's
        already occupied, the other tiles will shift over to make room.
        This allows you to move consecutive tiles with a single shift.
    </p>
    <h5>Undo a Play</h5>
    <p>The <b class="white-text"><i class="material-icons iem">replay</i>
        UNDO A PLAY</b> button, shown in Fig 4-U,
        allows you to undo the 4 most recent plays.
        This feature is in testing, and should only be used with the
        approval of other players.
    </p>
    <h5>Play Selection & Play Status</h5>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-ih-plays" src="media/h/h-ih-plays.jpg">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 5: In-Hand Plays</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-draw-flower" src="media/h/h-draw-flower.png">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 5X: Draw from the Flower Pile</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Plays can be made in two situations:</p>
    <ul class="browser-default">
        <li class="browser-default">when it's your turn, or</li>
        <li class="browser-default">when another player has discarded a tile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6><i>Your turn &mdash; in-hand plays:</i></h6>
    <p>When it's your turn, the most common situation is that your only
        possible play is to discard a tile.  This is the case shown
        in Fig 4.  The play selection area in the center of the screen
        shows only a discard as a possible play.
    </p>
    <p>Occasionally, you may have optional plays.  Fig 5 shows
        all four possible in-hand plays (5-J, 5-K, 5-L, 5-M):
    </p>
    <ul class="browser-default">
        <li class="browser-default"><b>(5-J):</b> discard a tile (always possible when it's your turn)</li>
        <li class="browser-default"><b>(5-K):</b> Woo - declare a win</li>
        <li class="browser-default"><b>(5-L):</b> Gng - convert a 3-set into a 4-set</li>
        <li class="browser-default"><b>(5-M):</b> Secret Gng - create a hidden 4-set from unplayed tiles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The discard play placeholder shown in Fig. 5-J is not a button,
        and only serves to remind you that you can always choose to discard
        a tile.  To discard a tile, drag any of your unplayed tiles above
        the red line shown in Fig. 5-D.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 3 optional plays shown in Fig. 5-K, 5-L, and 5-M are
        buttons that you can click to select that action.
    </p>
    <p>When you draw a flower tile, or make an optional 
        <i>Gng</i> play that requires
        that a replacement tile be drawn, you will see the <i>Draw</i>
        button with a red center, as shown in Fig 5X.  This means that
        the tile will be drawn from the flower pile.  When a Woo (win) is
        declared after drawing from the flower pile, a 4 &times; score
        multiplier applies, which appears in the scoring table as "ztail/ 槓上開花".
    </p>
    <h6><i>Other players turn &mdash; plays on discarded tiles:</i></h6>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-dis-plays" src="media/h/h-dis-plays.jpg">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 6: Plays on a Discarded Tile</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When other players are taking their turn, you may be able to make a
        play on their discarded tile.  In the example shown in Fig. 6,
        the player to your right, <i>r-Easton</i>, has discarded the
        tile in Fig. 6-R.  You have two possible plays:
    </p>
    <ul class="browser-default">
        <li class="browser-default"><b>(6-P):</b> draw a tile from the deck, ignoring the discarded tile, or</li>
        <li class="browser-default"><b>(6-Q):</b> Cha - grab the discarded tile to make a 3-straight</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the discarded tile came from any player other than the one on your
        right, the <i>Draw</i> button would be replaced with a <i>Pass</i>
        button.  The purpose of the <i>Pass</i> button is to ensure that you
        have a chance to see the discarded tile, even if you cannot make a
        play on it.
    </p>
    <h6><i>Waiting for other players to respond:</i></h6>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-dis-wait" src="media/h/h-dis-wait.jpg">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 7: Waiting on Other Players</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When there are other humans in the game, you will occasionally see
        a <i>Waiting for &mldr;</i> panel such as the one in Fig 7-S.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the example in Fig. 7, you have discarded the tile in Fig. 7-R,
        and you are waiting for other players to respond to your discard.
        A thinking animation appears for the players who have not yet
        responded, as shown in Fig. 7-T2 and Fig. 7-T4.  If another player
        decides to make a play, that play will appear in their thought cloud.
    </p>
    <p>If a human player leaves the game when the game is waiting on them
        for a response, a <b>Robot Play</b> button will appear next to their
        robot substitute's name in the area shown in Fig. 7-S.
        If you would like to have a robot player
        take over, click the <b>Robot Play</b> button.  Otherwise, the
        game will wait indefinitely for a human player to return.
    </p>

    <h5>Game End</h5>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-ready" src="media/h/h-ready.jpg">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 8: Ready Flags</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When a player is one tile away from a win, they must declare
        that they are "Ready".  This is shown in the game window as
        a flashing checkered flag, as shown in the two examples
        of Fig. 8, R1 and R3.
    </p>

    <h4>Other Controls</h4>
    <figure class="right min-content clearr">
        <img class="h-gnav" src="media/h/h-gnav.png">
        <figcaption><i>Fig. 9: Logo & menus</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>You can leave the game at any time by clicking on
        <b>Stand</b> (stand up from the game table),
        shown in Fig 9-St.
    </p>
    <h5>In-Game Chat</h5>
    <p>You can chat with other players in your game by opening the
        chat panel.  The chat icon,
        <i class="material-icons iem white-text">chat</i>,
        shown in Fig 9-C acts as a toggle to show or hide the chat panel.
        It is also a message indicator, and will flash green when you
        have unread chat messages.
